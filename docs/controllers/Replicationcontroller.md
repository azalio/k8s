NOTE: A Deployment that configures a ReplicaSet is now the recommended way to set up replication.

A ReplicationController ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time.

Common usage patterns:
* Rescheduling
* Scaling
* Rolling updates
* Multiple release tracks
* Using ReplicationControllers with Services
